				<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information collected by Cookies and similar technologies</span>: A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s device for record keeping purposes. Cookies can only be read by the server that sent them, and they cannot read data from the hard drive. We and/or our service providers may use cookies (and similar technologies) to collect and store certain information, such as your registration information, language preferences and other account settings, so you don't have to set them up every time you use our Services. We may also use these technologies to recognize your browser type as you navigate on the Internet and to collect aggregate and statistic information about your online activity on our site, such as the web pages you visit, the links you click, and the searches you conduct on our site. This allows us to better serve you with more tailored information and facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Services. Any user IDs, passwords, and any other user or account related data that we store in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes. We may allow our authorized service providers to access the information collected by cookies from our Website or Services to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of our site, content and advertising. To learn more about cookies, please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="aboutCookiesWin">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a>.

				<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information collected by third parties</span>: We may allow third parties, including our authorized service providers, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our site and/or App (we do not sell your Personal Information to any of the foregoing). Note that these parties may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers end users a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (<a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org" target="networkAdvertisingWin">www.networkadvertising.org</a>). Alternatively, you can opt out of some third-party vendor's use of cookies for interest-based advertising by visiting <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="aboutadsWin">http://www.aboutads.info/</a>. Unless expressly stated otherwise, our website does not provide Personal Information to these third parties. This Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the tracking technologies and activities of, those other advertisers, third-party advertising networks, or third-party advertising servers.</p>

				<p><strong>4.	How We Share Your Information</strong></p>
				<p>In order to provide the Services and enhance your experience, we may share your information with the following entities:</p>
				<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Party Service Providers</span>: including but not limited to accommodation facilities, transportation services, insurance services, equipment rental services, attractions, caregivers, payment services or any other third-party services ("Third Party Service Providers"). Information that we share with Third Party Service Providers to facilitate reservations will be treated according to applicable suppliers’ privacy policies. We encourage you to review the privacy policies, terms of use, and other policies of any Third Party Service Provider whose products and services you may purchase through accessibleGO. Please note that these suppliers also may contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about you or your travel plans, to facilitate your travel reservations, or for other purposes consistent with the practices described in their privacy policies and terms of use.</p>

				<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Party Vendors</span>: including but not limited to third party vendors who provide us with services such as business analytics, payment processing, customer service, marketing, public relations, distribution of surveys or sweepstakes programs, and fraud prevention ("Third Party Vendors"). We may also authorize Third Party Vendors to collect information on our behalf, including, for example, as necessary to operate features of our Website or to facilitate the delivery of online advertising tailored to your interests. Third Party Vendors have access to and may collect information only as needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose.</p>

				<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Social Media Services</span>. We may offer you the choice to access certain third party social media websites and services through our site (such as Facebook). When you do so, you are sharing information with those sites, and the information you share will be governed by their privacy policies. You may also be able to modify your privacy settings with these third party social media websites.</p>

				<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other Users</span>: If you choose to create a profile on accessibleGO, certain information in your profile will be publicly viewable and identifiable via your screen name. You will have the ability to view your profile as members of the public will see it. However, we will not share your email address with any other members nor display it any public manner.</p>

				<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-Personal Information</span>: We also may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors our Website receives or the most popular hotels and vacation destinations. This information does not contain any personal information and is used to develop content and services we hope you will find of interest.</p>

				<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Affiliates</span>. This relates to entities that are legally part of the same group of companies that we are part of, or that become part of that group. Similarly, if we engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding, we may transfer the information to our new owner.</p>

				<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Legal Compliance</span>: We may disclose Personal Information (i) as a response to a legal request (such as a court order, search warrant, or subpoena) if we believe that we are required to do so by applicable law; or (ii) when we believe that such disclosure or use is necessary in order to: reveal, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activities; enforce this Policy or our Terms of Use, including in order to investigate potential breaches; protect our rights, property or safety, or those of our users or from members of the public from harm, as required or permitted by applicable law; and prevent death or imminent bodily harm.</p>

				<p>Other than as set out above, you will be notified when personal information about you will be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to have us share such information.</p>
			</div>

			<div style="margin-top:1em;">
				<p><strong>5.	How We Secure Your Information</strong></p>
				<p>We consider data security a top priority and we do our best to keep your Personal Information secure. We restrict access to your information to our employees and others who we feel must use it to provide our products and services. We also maintain electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your information.</p>

				<p>Although we take organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect your Personal Information, no method of transmitting or storing electronic data is ever completely secure. Therefore you cannot reasonably expect and we cannot promise or guarantee that such information will be immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unlawful interceptions or access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse. Please be aware that we may use third-party cloud service providers that provide hosting, data storage and other services pursuant to their standard terms and conditions that are generally non-negotiable, and accordingly, we may be unable to impose contractual obligations on them with respect to the measures they use to protect Personal Information.</p>

				<p>If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the "Contact Us" section below.</p>

			<div style="margin-top:1em;">
